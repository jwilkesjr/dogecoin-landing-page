# Responsive Dogecoin Landing Page 

This project is a modification of ASMR Programming's YouTube Tutorial on building a responsive NFT landing page. We've adapted it to the exciting world of Dogecoin, using modern HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to create a dynamic and responsive landing page. 

## Key Features

- **Real-Time API Integration**: We've utilized the CoinGecko API to fetch the current price of Dogecoin, ensuring users are always informed of the latest market price.
  
- **CSS linear-gradient**: Creates visually appealing gradient backgrounds.
  
- **CSS Grid**: Facilitates a flexible layout structure that is easy to modify and maintain.
  
- **CSS Flexbox**: Ensures easy and efficient arrangement of elements, regardless of their original size and order.
  
- **Media queries**: Ensures our design is responsive and provides an optimal viewing experience across a range of devices.
  
- **CSS transitions and animations (keyframes)**: Enhances user engagement through dynamic effects.

## Improvements

We've made several improvements over the original NFT landing page. These include:

- **API Integration**: The use of CoinGecko's API to display real-time Dogecoin prices.
  
- **Semantic Changes**: We've adjusted the content to reflect the focus on Dogecoin, providing accurate and up-to-date information on transaction fees and Dogecoin-related processes.
